	<h1>Depeche Mode</h1>
	<h2>Clean</h2>
	<p>The cleanest I've been 
		An end to the tears 
		And the in-between years 
		And the troubles I've seen
	</p>
	
	<p>Now that I'm clean 
		You know what I mean 

		I've broken my fall 
		Put an end to it all 
		I've changed my routine 
		Now I'm clean
	</p>

	<p>I don't understand 
		What destiny's planned 
		I'm starting to grasp 
		What is in my own hands
	</p>
